Axolotl is a processor of my creation. On this repository you will find all the toolchain for axolotl. 
For this instant the tools chain regroup : 
* The design and architecture of the processor write in VHDL
* The constraint file for synthesis and implementation on a FPGA (basys3)
* The Assembler for translating assembly code source to byte code
* The simulator to emulate the comportement of Axolotl processor

IN THE FUTURE : 
* a fonctionnality to televerse code from your computer into an fpga with the processor on it
* ...
